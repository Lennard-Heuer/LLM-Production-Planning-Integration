"""
9. Model: Production Planning with Setup and Capacity Constraints

Parameters:

time_horizon: Total number of periods (planning horizon).
products_total: List of products.
workstations_total: Total number of workstations.

profit[i]: Profit per unit of product i.
holding_costs[i]: Holding cost per unit of product i.
max_demand[i][t]: Maximum demand for product i in period t.
min_sales[i][t]: Minimum sales required for product i in period t.
workstation_capacity[w][t]: Capacity of workstation w in period t.
initial_inventory[i]: Initial inventory of product i at the start of period 1.

production_time[i][w]: Time required on workstation w to produce one unit of product i.
setup_cost[i]: Setup cost for switching to product i.

Decision Variables:

X[i][t]: Amount of product i produced in period t.
S[i][t]: Amount of product i sold in period t.
I[i][t]: Inventory of product i at the end of period t.
Y[i][t]: Binary setup variable for product i in period t (1 if setup is active, 0 otherwise).

Objective:

Maximize the total profit across all products and periods, minus holding costs and setup costs.

Constraints:

1. Sales Constraints: Ensure that the sales of each product are within the minimum and maximum demand bounds.
2. Inventory Balance: Ensure that inventory in each period reflects production, previous inventory, and sales.
3. Capacity Constraints: Ensure that total production does not exceed the capacity of the workstations in each period.
4. Production Setup Constraints: Production is allowed only if the setup variable is active for the product in the period.
5. Unique Setup Constraint: Only one product can be set up at any given time.
