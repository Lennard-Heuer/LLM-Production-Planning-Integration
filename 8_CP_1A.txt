"""
1. Model: Function to optimize aggregate production planning without workstations

Parameters:
time_horizon (int): Number of periods in the planning horizon.
profit (list of float): Profit per unit for each product (list of size equal to the number of products).
holding_costs (list of float): Holding costs per unit for each product (list of size equal to the number of products).
max_demand (list of list of float): Maximum demand for each product in each period (2D list with dimensions [products x periods]).
product_capacity  (list of list of float): Production capacity for each product in each period (2D list with dimensions [products x periods]).
initial_inventory (list of float): Initial inventory for each product at the start of the first period (list of size equal to the number of products).
products_total (int): Total number of products being considered in the model.

Returns:
dict: Optimal values of decision variables and total profit.
