"""
7. Model: Function to optimize aggregate procution planning with multiple products - Yield loss

Parameters:

products_total: Total number of products.
workstations_total: Total number of workstations.
time_horizon: Planning horizon (number of periods).
max_demand: Maximum demand for each product in each period.
min_sales: Minimum sales allowed for each product in each period.
production_time: Time required on each workstation to produce one unit of each product.
workstation_capacity: Capacity of each workstation for each period.
profit: Net profit from one unit of each product.
holding_cost: Cost to hold one unit of each product for one period.
initial_inventory: Initial inventory for each product.
backorder_penalty: Penalty for not being able to satisfy the demand for one unit of each product.
yield_loss: Cumulative yield loss from each station onward for each product.

# Define indexes:
i = an index of product, i = 1, . . . ,m, so m represents total number of products
t = an index of period, t = 1, . . . , ¯t, so ¯t represents planning horizon

# Define the parameters:
max_demand[i][t] = maximum demand for product i in period t
min_sales[i][t] = minimum sales allowed of product i in period t

production_time[i][j] = time required on workstation j to produce one unit of product i
workstation_capacity[j][t] = capacity of workstation j in period t in units consistent with those used to define production_time[i][j]

yield_loss[i][j] = cumulative yield from station j onward (including station j) for product i

profit[i] = net profit from one unit of product i
holding_cost[i] = cost to hold one unit of product i for one period t

# Define the Decision Variables:
X[i][t] = amount of product i produced in period t
S[i][t] = amount of product i sold in period t
I[i][t] = inventory of product i at end of period t (Ii0 is given as data)
