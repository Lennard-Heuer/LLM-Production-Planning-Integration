"""
4. Model: Function to optimize aggregate procution planning with multiple products. - incl. Capacity Reduciton Factor

Parameters:

products_total: Total number of products.
workstations_total: Total number of workstations.
time_horizon: Time horizon (number of periods).
max_demand: Maximum demand for each product in each period.
min_sales: Minimum sales required for each product in each period.
production_time: Production time required for each product on each workstation.
workstation_capacity: Capacity of each workstation for each period.
profit: Net profit per unit for each product.
holding_costs: Holding costs per unit for each product.
initial_inventory: Initial inventory for each product.
capacity_reduction_factor: Percentage of the capacity that should be used practically at max.

# Define indexes
i = an index of product, i = 1, . . . ,m, so m represents total number of products
t = an index of period, t = 1, . . . , ¯t, so ¯t represents planning horizon

# Define the parameters
max_demand[i][t] = maximum demand for product i in period t
min_sales[i][t] = minimum sales allowed of product i in period t

production_time[i][j] = time required on workstation j to produce one unit of product i
workstation_capacity[j][t] = capacity of workstation j in period t in units consistent with those used to define production_time[i][j]
capacity_reduction_factor[j] = Percentage of the capacity that should be used practically at max
profit[i] = net profit from one unit of product i
holding_costs[i] = cost to hold one unit of product i for one period t

# Define the Decision Variables:
X[i][t] = amount of product i produced in period t
S[i][t] = amount of product i sold in period t
I[i][t] = inventory of product i at end of period t (Ii0 is given as data)
